# Pong
 A very basic pong game started from scratch in Java

# Download Warning
***** Read this as there are a couple things to note ******

* The download MAY flag up as a virus, it is a bug to do with the compression for the zip file (I have no idea how to fix it)
* This game was developed using Java 1.6, do not ask me why but it's the way it is. I _highly_ recommend you use the launcher incase newer java versions break the game. The correct java version is bundled with the download and all the launcher does is run the game jar file from the java1.6 directory. (don't rename anything it will break too lol)
* Have fun and try not to off yourself playing it :)
